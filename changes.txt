T-Engine 3.0.0alpha19 aka "Bless The Child"

??  changes:
- Stores can now generate items along a theme (store_maker = "random_theme")

Bug changes:
- Fix vaults flag constraints
- Uniques can now be generated as long as they are alive and artifacts as
  long as they haven't been identified (preserve mode only).
  n returning to a saved level where a killed (found) unique (artifact)
  ides, it will be deleted.
- Fixed projection effects with non-standard colors. 
  However, these are no longer customisable by the *.prf files
- Fixed BUGGY SKELETONS, allowing proper rotting of corpse
- Fixed several memory leaks.
- Fixed travel across map squares in the see-through wilderness mode.

Monster changes:
- New ESCORT_IGNORE_DUNGEON flag for monsters with escort
  (Escorting monsters will ignore dungeon restrictions)
- Amount of FRIENDS monsters no longer raise with the dungeon level
- Implemented breeding monsters using ai.BREEDING

Dungeon changes:
- Minimum level for vaults can now be specified using the "level" parameter.
- Nests and pits are now module-definable and use the Lua subsystem nests_and_pits.

Object changes:
- Egos can only be generated starting at their level.
  Items can modify this by defining MIN_EGO_LEVEL and MAX_EGO_LEVEL.
- Replaced MAX_QUANTITY by BASE_QUANTITY and SCALED_QUANTITY
- Implemented corpse decaying on the floor. 
  Hopefully it won't be much of an overhead.
- Made corpse decaying optional and off by default. Set use_corpse_decay = true
  to turn it on.
