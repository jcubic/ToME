[D]- Player tunneling has been turned into a Lua subsystem.  As an
     example of the subsystem's flexibility, picks and shovels can
     no longer be used to "tunnel" through webs.  Instead, lit
     torches can be used to burn down webs, and bladed weapons can
     be used to cut through them, with fire or acid brands greatly
     increasing the web destroying power of the weapon.
