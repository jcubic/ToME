This directory should contain all the packs that are to be used by the
various modules.
For example if an author decides to do three modules:
1) The Space War: The begginning
2) The Space War: The coming back of the shadows
3) The Space War: Now it's getting nasty
Then the actual Space War settings(skills scripts, monsters, items ...)
can be put in the pack and loaded by the modules.
