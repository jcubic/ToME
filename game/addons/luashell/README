ToME Lua Shell

A quick'n'dirty lua shell for debugging and experimenting.

Drop the whole luashell directory inside your lib/patch
directory. ToME should autoload it. It should work with 2.2 and CVS,
but it's mainly tested against CVS.

Then do:

^A>shell.run()

(I make a macro for it on my debugging characters)

There is help included.
