This directory contains various subsystems that are usualy
needed by a roguelike(like hunger system, eating, quaffing, ...)
but that still need to be requested by the modules, in case they
dont want them/make their own.

If a system is called hunger.lua in there, the module just needs to do in
its init.lua file:
load_subsystem("hunger")
